							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I thought this article was very interesting seeing science, tech, and design all come together and provide explanations behind choices and how humans think. I did not know so much goes into this specific topic. I like how there were different examples of attention, such as the cocktail part effect. I now will think about all these methods when designing in the future. </p>
