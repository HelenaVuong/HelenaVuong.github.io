                            <p> My favorite interface was the easy grow app. I really liked how the background color changed when different fruits were presented. This helps to keep the audience interested and not bored. I also thought the different motions and directions helps clients better understand where subjects will be. Overall it is pleasant to the eye and fun to go through, which makes me want to explore every tab.</p>
