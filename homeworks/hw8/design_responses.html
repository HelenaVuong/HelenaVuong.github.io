						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>  “In many cases, the installation occurs in a pop-up window, where you have to read and go through multiple steps, configuring options when required. But every UX designer knows that people don’t read, they scan. What happens, in the end, is that people only look at the window for enough time to find the buttons that will make the installation go through and they click ‘ok’ or ‘next’ without giving it much thought. Throughout these windows, it’s common to see some other software or plug-in being “pushed” to the user, as they leave the option that accepts these programs checked by default. When speeding through the interface, the user doesn’t realize that he accepted something unexpected.”</p>
